# Yield Curve Inversion-Aware Robo Advisor 🧠📉

This project combines deep learning, financial macro indicators, and portfolio optimization to build an intelligent robo-advisor that dynamically adjusts investment recommendations based on the risk of a future **yield curve inversion** — a strong historical signal for recession.

🔹 **Module 1.1** – LSTM-based Yield Curve Inversion Predictor (AI-enhanced)  
🔹 **Module 2** – Macro-aware Portfolio Optimizer using historical market data  
🔹 **Module 3** – Personalized Robo Advisor that adjusts strategy based on user goals and macro risk
